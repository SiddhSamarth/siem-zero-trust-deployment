## 🔍 Initial Network Vulnerability Assessment

As part of our security consulting engagement with XYZ Exchange—a major cryptocurrency trading platform—this report outlines critical vulnerabilities identified in their existing perimeter network architecture. The findings below form the foundation for our comprehensive security redesign, intended to enhance confidentiality, integrity, and availability across the infrastructure.

In the aftermath of a major breach that resulted in the theft of over **500 Bitcoins**, our team from **SecureCorp** was contracted to investigate and mitigate weaknesses that enabled the compromise. This phase focuses on the **initial architectural risk assessment**.

### 🔓 1. Flat Network Architecture (Lack of Segmentation)

**Observation:** All application servers—including web servers, database servers, and a file storage server—reside within a single subnet, without logical or physical segmentation.

**Risk:** This setup presents a **lateral movement vulnerability**. Should an attacker compromise a single host, unrestricted access to all other systems in the network becomes possible. This violates the principle of least privilege and modern network segmentation standards.

**Business Impact:** In the event of an exploit on a public-facing system, internal data stores and file servers are immediately exposed—leading to high-severity data breaches and compliance violations.

---

### 🌐 2. Uncontrolled Internet Accessibility

**Observation:** All servers are configured with direct access to the internet—bypassing DMZ boundaries, ingress filtering, or gateway controls.

**Risk:** The network lacks **perimeter defense** mechanisms such as firewalls, NAT, or web application gateways. Each server becomes a public endpoint, enabling threat actors to conduct reconnaissance, brute-force login attempts, or exploit known CVEs directly.

**Business Impact:** This design choice significantly increases the **attack surface**, making the organization susceptible to DDoS, malware injection, and external exploitation attempts.

### 📂 3. Unrestricted File Storage Server Access

**Observation:** The file storage server, containing sensitive corporate data, is accessible from any network path—including public routes.

**Risk:** There is no access control, segmentation, or encrypted tunnel enforced for the file server. This lack of governance exposes the organization to **data exfiltration**, **insider threats**, and **unauthorized access**.

**Business Impact:** Loss or theft of internal documents, credentials, or sensitive trade records could lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.

## 🚨 Conclusion & Advisory

The existing architecture demonstrates fundamental weaknesses in **network design, perimeter control, and internal data governance**. These flaws collectively enabled one of the most significant breaches in XYZ's operational history.

### Key Recommendations
- Implement **network segmentation** between public-facing services and internal resources using subnets, VLANs, and access control lists.
- Introduce **firewalls** and **DMZs** to establish trust boundaries and control external exposure.
- Deploy **VPN tunnels** and endpoint authentication to enforce secure, encrypted access to sensitive services.
